Machinist is a game engine for JavaScript. It uses features of HTML5 such as the <canvas> and <audio> tags.

The following is a small example featuring movement with the arrow keys and playing a sound when the spacebar is pressed:

  guy = {
    sprite: new Sprite("res/test.png"),
    sound: new Sound("res/test.ogg"),
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    update: function() {
      if (key(keys.up)) this.y -= 4;
      if (key(keys.down)) this.y += 4;
      if (key(keys.left)) this.x -= 4;
      if (key(keys.right)) this.x += 4;
      
      if (key(keys.space)) this.sound.play();
    },
    draw: function() {
      this.sprite.draw(this.x, this.y);
    }
  };

  level1 = new Scene(guy);

  game("canvas", level1);

Game code must be `load`ed from an html file.
